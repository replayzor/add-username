# Add Username

  This is a simple React application that allows a user to add a username and age, which are 
  then displayed in a list of users. The user's input is validated to ensure that both the
  username and age are valid.

# Technologies Used

This application was built using the following technologies:

- React
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Vite

# Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your 
local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/replayzor/add-username.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
`cd add-username`

3. Install the required dependencies:
`npm install`

4. Start the application
`npm run dev`

# Usage
Once the application is running, you can add a new user by entering a username and age in 
the input fields and clicking the "Add User" button. If either the username or age is invalid 
(i.e. empty or non-numeric), an error message will be displayed.

The list of users is updated in real-time as new users are added.
